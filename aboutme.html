          <h2>Day 6 Reflection</h2>
    <p>The logic behind scratch and python are similar. The program I made in scratch to make shapes was what I based my program in python off of. The inputs for python are more realistic and based on common sense so it is easier to figure out rather than having to find the blocks that will do what I want.</p>
    <p>I think it was easier than when using scratch because in the terminal when there is an error it directs you to the line where the error is so it is very easy to go back to your program and find that exactr error.</p>

   
      
    <h2>Day 7 Reflection</h2>
    <p>Today my game was very successful and fun to make. I learned a lot about conditionals and functions.</p>
    
    <h2>Day 8 Reflection</h2>
    <p>A list is a easy way to oragnize items and to call upon multiple things at once. Working in a group for the final project was very helpful because it was the hardest to find a starting point and we were able to bounce ideas off of each other to make our final product.</p>
    
    <h2>Day 9 Reflection</h2>
    <p>I really liked Refinery 29 because it was a very interactive braingstorming session and it was an accurate representation of what some people's work days look like. It also showed me that I would love to work at a company that is as relaxed and hip as Refinery 29.</p>
    
    <h2>Day 10 Reflection</h2>
    <p>Today I did very well doing the hardware and working with my group. I need to work on the software part of the project and better understand how my work in hardware connects to the software.</p>
    
    <h2>Day 11 Reflection</h2>
    <p>Today was very complicated but in the end we got our robot to move and turn and play music even if it wasn't all at the same time.</p>
    
    <h2>Day 12 Reflection</h2>
    <p>Today I had fun expanding on my project and taking the time to understand the programming behind it. I was frusturated with thte fact that we were not given enough resources to properly complete the tasks we were given.</p>
