    <h2>Day 6 Reflection</h2>
    <p1>The logic behind scratch and python are similar. The program I made in scratch to make shapes was what I based my program in python off of. The inputs for python are more realistic and based on common sense so it is easier to figure out rather than having to find the blocks that will do what I want.</p1>
    <p2>I think it was easier than when using scratch because in the terminal when there is an error it directs you to the line where the error is so it is very easy to go back to your program and find that exactr error.</p2>
  
    <h3>Day 7 Reflection</h3>
    <p3>Today my game was very successful and fun to make. I learned a lot about conditionals and functions.</p3>
